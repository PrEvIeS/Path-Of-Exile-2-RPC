## ⚙️ Install guide:
1. Install Python 3.11 or higher.
2. Install the package and dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. Run the app: `poe2-rpc run` (or `python -m poe2_rpc run`).
4. Ensure that Discord is running.

Optional config: drop a `config.toml` at `%APPDATA%\poe2-rpc\config.toml` on
Windows (or `~/.config/poe2-rpc/config.toml` on macOS/Linux for dev). Defaults
work without one.

CLI commands: `poe2-rpc run` (continuous monitor), `poe2-rpc once` (single
log-stream pass), `poe2-rpc validate-config --no-discord` (validate settings
+ bundled assets without contacting Discord IPC).

### 🖥️ Run as a background service (Windows tray)

Install the optional tray extras first, then launch the tray icon and
register it with Windows Startup so it boots on login:

```bash
pip install "poe2-rpc[tray]"
poe2-rpc tray              # foreground tray (Status / Open log / Restart / Quit)
poe2-rpc install-autostart # Startup-folder shortcut so it launches on login
poe2-rpc uninstall-autostart
```

Notes:

- The tray runs the orchestrator on a background thread; `Quit` performs an
  orderly shutdown of the log-stream watcher.
- The shortcut points at the running interpreter / packaged `.exe` and passes
  `tray --quiet` so no console window is spawned at login.
- Use `poe2-rpc tray --quiet` from PowerShell if you launch it manually and
  want to suppress the console.

**For convenience, a pre-compiled .exe is available in the releases section.
